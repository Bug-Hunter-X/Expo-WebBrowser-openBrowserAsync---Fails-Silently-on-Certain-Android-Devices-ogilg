# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync() Fails Silently on Certain Android Devices

This repository demonstrates a bug where `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync()` from Expo fails silently on some Android devices. The function returns a successful result, but the browser never actually opens.

## Problem

The `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync()` function, when called on certain Android devices and versions, reports success even when the browser fails to launch. This makes debugging difficult since there's no clear error message.

## Solution

A potential solution involves checking the Android system's default browser settings and handling any exceptions that might occur during the browser launch process.  This requires more robust error handling and may need platform-specific code.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains the minimal code to reproduce the issue.  You can run this Expo app and test it on various Android devices to see if it consistently fails on some devices.  Note that the specific Android versions and devices affected may vary.

## Note

The proposed solution in `bugSolution.js` is a suggested approach that may need further adaptation depending on your specific needs and the device/version where the issue occurs.
